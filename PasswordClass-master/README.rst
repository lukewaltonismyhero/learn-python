The Run Down
============

This is all made for fun.  This is inspired by the very first chapter of the book
"Violent Python"[#]_.  Go read that book, it's a lot of fun! All proceeds from 
sales of Violent Python will go directly towards the Wounded Warrior Project [#]_.

The goals of this project are as follows:
    
    * Learn about opening and manipulating files
    * Learn just how fast a laptop can be with some simple Python code
    * See for yourself why plaintext passwords are for babies!


Warning
=======

What we're learning today can be harmless, however you should be aware of local 
laws before you go and do something rash.

Also:  Be sure to follow this in order, atleast the first time.  Some files 
will purposely overwrite one another.  It's ok.


Credit Where Credit is Due
==========================

Thank you to the class for giving me the chance to share.  Thank you Esther for giving me a shot at showing the class something fun and cool.
Thank you Andrew for teaming up with Esther to keep sanity in this project, all the while maintaining "knowing nothing"!

The included dictionary file "british-english" is copied from my Ubuntu 12.04.2 distribution.
